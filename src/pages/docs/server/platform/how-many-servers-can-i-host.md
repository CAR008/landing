# How many server can I host?

To keep the server list clean and to allow everyone to have a chance to make a name in the list of servers we only allow a certain amount of servers per game type:  
T6MP and T6ZM are two different game types, just like T6MP and IW5MP are two different games, they're all considered as different games.

Currently the server limits are as follows:

- Up to 10 servers for multiplayer per game
- Up to 15 servers for zombies per game

You are also limited to 30 servers in total per IP address.

So for example having 15 T6ZM servers, 10 T6MP and 5 IW5MP servers is allowed.
