# Can I go to Max Rank without having to grind?

Yes, you can use the UnlockAll feature on every game supported either with a command or, when supported, with the game's menus.  

## UnlockAll with a command

For any game you can unlock everything and go to the max level and prestige by using a command like explained below.  

* [Open the Console](/docs/opening-console)  
* Type `UnlockAll` and then press enter.  
* Open the server browser, join any server and play until you load into a different map.  
* Once the next map has loaded, quit the server and change your classes.  

<Alert variant="warning">

Be sure to play until the next map loads or your classes won't save!

### T5

When using the Unlock All feature make sure to customize at least 3 custom classes before going online to avoid getting an error.  
You can simply change a single element of 3 classes like the primary weapon.

You can also customize your prestige using the `statsetbyname plevel 14` command in [the console](/docs/opening-console).  
Replace `14` by the prestige you want.
