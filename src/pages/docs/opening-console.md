# How to open the console

Once you launch your specific game, press the key under ESC.  
This will usually be tilde (\` or \~) or ² on AZERTY keyboards.

If you have a 60% keyboard you should press FN and ESC instead.

You can also use the bootstrapper's terminal to run commands (the cmd that opens with the game)
